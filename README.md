# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is called AirBnB Temp.


It is an application that has been designed by Cristina Soneira, Francisco Aguil√≥, Maria Victoria and Raffael Martinez, and has been developed by Robin Bucad and Alba Huertas.

The idea of the web was to create an application that offers you the weather of the city, and what plans you can make depending on the weather.
At the moment the activities are only developed in the search of Madrid and Valencia.
